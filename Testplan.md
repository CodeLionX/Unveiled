# Unveiled - Master Test Plan

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
This Master Test Plan describes how the project "Unveiled" will be tested during development and before it is shipped. It should provide a common basis for all team members how testing in this project is organizied and executed. This document gathers all information necessary to plan and control the test effort for the project "Unveiled".

### 1.2 Scope
This document addresses the following types and levels of testing:

- Unit Tests
- Functional Tests
- User Interface and Usability Tests
- Load Tests (**really??**)

There is no need to test the webinterface with unit or functional tests, because it does not contain any testable logic. In addition it will also not be covered by Unit Tests, because the time scale of this project is to short to allow a high effort in testing it. It is more important that the other components of the "Unveiled" application will be covered by tests. See section 3 for the targeted test items.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations
In this section definitions and explanations of acronyms and abbreviations are listed to help the reader to understand these.

- **UC** Use Case
- **SAD** Software Architecture Document
- **OUCD** Overall Use Case Diagram
