## Our Vision
Everyday a huge number of undetected crimes are committed on this planet. 
Whistleblowers try to impart those crimes to the community although politics and public authorities put rocks in their way. 
This project shall help these journalists and dedicated individuals to publish and save their captured video and photo material 
wherefore they have perhaps put their life at risk. Our Application addresses exactly this point.

People using our App can take pictures and videos which are immediately uploaded to our servers. There they are stored in a private 
library only accessible to the owner. Through a web based interface you are able to publish your recorded content.
